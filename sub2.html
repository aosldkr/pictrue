                <h3>Medieval Art</h3>
                <p class="Medieval-subtitle">The period from the 4th to the 14th centuries BC was an absolute period of Christian value. Symbolic and supernatural art and
                    church architecture based on religious content centered on Christianity are typical, and this period is viewed as an art and culture and artistic dark period (more church rules and values than individual thoughts or painting styles). Medieval art can be seen as Byzantine, Romanesque, and Gothic art.

                    <h3>Byzantine Art</h3>
                    <p>Byzantine art is a term used to refer to the works of art of the Eastern Roman Empire from the 4th century to the fall
                        of Constantinople in 1453. Because Byzantine art had a great influence on Renaissance art, Byzantine art was the ancestor
                        of Renaissance art and... It's a primitive Renaissance art.Around the 5th and 6th centuries, it is a time when Eastern and
                        Western art were fused by mixing realism and Western Hellenistic art in the Orient region, and it is characterized by dome
                        style and mosaic decoration.

                        Art activities have also changed their character to losing the court-centered all-European thing and being created in units
                        of monasteries that have been revived in various places. Therefore, each local style became one of the characteristics of
                        Romanesque art. Religious art, which was a symbol of authority, was embodied by the hand of a monk, and gradually expressed
                        the character of a commentary of doctrine through painting, that is, as a "biblical view in painting." It was also a process
                        of popularization of faith. In this way, churches decorated with statues were

                    <p>
                        Gothic art, or Gothic art, is a medieval art movement that developed in northern France in the late 12th century following
                        Romanesque art.Since its first popularity in France, it has spread throughout Western Europe and the northern Alps, and has
                        become a representative art style of medieval Europe. Despite regional differences, the Gothic art movement continued into 
                        the 15th century and led to the Renaissance.Gothic painting, along with the development of realistic trends, was transformed
                        into a decline in pure crafts, but copy was prevalent mainly in Paris in the 13th century.
