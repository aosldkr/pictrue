                <h3>Modern Art</h3>
                <p>
                    Modern art refers to art from the 1860s to the 1970s. It includes works of art from around the 1860s to the 1970s,
                    and also refers to the forms and philosophies of art that arose during this period.  Modern art is usually related
                    to art that pursues the spirit of modernism experimentation and abandons the tradition of the past. Modern artists
                    experimented with new perspectives and fresh ideas about the nature of art's materials and roles. It is the 
                    characteristic of more modern art to move away from the description, which is a characteristic of traditional 
                    art, and to aim for abstraction.   And modern art developed into neoclassicalism, romanticism, realism, and impressionism.

                    <h3>Neo classicism Art</h3>
                    <p>
                        It is an art style inspired by ancient Greek and Roman culture that began in England
                        in the late 18th century and appeared throughout Europe, mainly in France. In opposition
                        to the sensuous and colorful trends of previous period art Rococo and Baroque styles,
                        it emphasized intellectual, rational, and moral art. It features classical themes such
                        as myths, Scriptures, and historical events, balanced composition, emphasis on shipping
                        elements, clear historical evidence in architectural background and costume representations,
                        and smooth surface descriptions to the extent that brush marks are not visible.

                    <h3>Romanticism Art</h3>
                    <p>
                        Romanticism arose in opposition to the rationalism of neoclassicism, placing importance
                        on subjectivity rather than objectivity, emotion over reason, and emphasizing freedom
                        rather than law, respecting individuality, and admiring infinite things. Romantic artists
                        protested against the hard and demanding norms of neoclassicalism before and after the
                        Great Revolution, culminating in the enactment of Academyism, especially Napoleon. In
                        other words, romantic artists abandoned Greek and Roman classics to pursue medieval and
                        Gothic styles, and sublimated orientalism to more than just exotic tastes. In romantic
                        painting, the method of painting, that is, the subjective method or subjective expression,
                        was more important than the subject matter of painting.

                    <h3>Realistic Art</h3>
                    <p>
                        Realism is a French art trend that rose to its peak in the 1850s by
                        Gustave Courbet (1819-1877) and Honore Daumier (1808-1879), contrary
                        to neoclassical or romanticism. Realist painters refrained from expressing
                        their emotions by breaking away from traditional themes, and realistically
                        portrayed daily life and contradictory events that took place before their
                        eyes. Kurbe expressed his artistic will by saying, "I can't draw an angel
                        because I've never seen an angel," and when his work at the World Expo was
                        rejected in 1855, he built a tent near the exhibition hall and set up a
                        sign of Realism at the entrance to declare realism for the first time.
                        Domier, who was also a realist painter and engraver, satirized the
                        immorality of French society under the theme of corrupt politics and
                        the poor in France in the 19th century.

                    <h3>Impressionism Art</h3>
                    <p>
                        Impressionism or impressionism is an art trend that rejects traditional painting
                        techniques and pays attention to color, color tone, and texture itself. Painters
                        who pursued impressionism are called impressionists, who tried to accurately and
                        objectively record the visible world using the instantaneous effects of color or
                        color, while describing nature in changes in color and color. In the 1860s, artists
                        in Paris began to lead. The name Impressionism originated from Claude Monet's oil
                        painting "Impression, Sunrise", which was first used in criticism by critic Louis
                        Leroy in the journal "Le Charivari". Impressionist art influenced the development
                        of impressionist music and impressionist literature.

                    <h3>Neo impressionism Art</h3>
                    <p>
                        Neo-impressionism is a French painting movement or style of the late 19th century
                        that attempts to support the theory and scientificity of impressionism. It is also
                        called the New Impressionists. It was influenced by optical theory or color theory
                        such as Charles Henry (1859-1926), and its biggest feature in technology is that visual
                        mixing is thoroughly carried out by uniform divided brush strokes.It was the first clear
                        appearance during the last Impressionist exhibition in 1886, and Soura and Sinac are
                        representative beings. The New Impressionists made the Impressionists' theory of color
                        more scientifically clear, and they produced extremely theoretical production centered on Seora.
