                <h3>Early Modern Art</h3>
                <p>
                    The concept of public power began to emerge due to the stability of central power and
                    emerged after the French Revolution in the 14th and 18th centuries until the civil
                    revolution when the king and aristocrat class collapsed.Through social transformation
                    through skepticism about religion (the collapse of the neo-centered metaphysical worldview),
                    limited democracy, etc. It explored human status and values, and along with humanism and 
                    rationalism, a revolution in science was formed that went beyond the basic science of the
                    Greek era.In addition, it is characterized by a change in the supply and demand structure
                    of art, centered on paintings such as portraits, rather than portraits.

                    <h3>Renaissance Art</h3>
                    <p>
                        Art trends that began in Italy in the 14th century and peaked throughout
                        Europe in the 16th century. Originally, the term Renaissance, which means
                        "rebirth" in French, encompasses a transition period to mark the end of the
                        middle century and the start of the modern era, in addition to a specific
                        era in the literary and artistic movements.The Renaissance basically meant
                        a cultural and artistic revival, especially a conscious movement to revive
                        Greek and Roman culture.As they returned to Florence and began their work
                        using their classical knowledge, the art of the ancient world came to light again.

                    <h3>Baroque Art</h3>
                    <p>
                        Baroque art focuses on capturing dynamic forms, maximizing the contrast between light and
                        darkness, and emphasizes balance through harmony of parts that depend on the whole, and
                        the balance is made up of perfect parts.I can't compare it to the overall balance of the
                        High Renaissance, but it was closer to the balance of the Renaissance than the deliberate
                        dissonance of mannerism or the fragmentation of Rococo. In the case of painting, the overall
                        characteristics include diagonal composition, perspective, shortening, and the use of eye-cheating effects.

                    <h3>Rococo Art</h3>
                    <p>
                        a style of decoration that originated from rokaiyu and was popular in Europe in the 18th
                        century Following the Baroque style, it is a style that precedes neoclassicalism and refers
                        to the style that spans the entire art, including architecture, sculpture, painting, and crafts
                        of the time. It is common with Baroque in that it dislikes straight lines and loves curved, curved,
                        elaborate decorations. compared to the powerful latter, Rococo is rather elegant and light, with S-shaped
                        curves, non-symmetrical decorations, and an exotic atmosphere, especially the Chinese style. This is about
                        the magnificent and splendid palace of the Baroque period, the appearance of an elegant salon, a social hall
                        of the new era, and It was also influenced by the hobbies of influential court ladies. Instead of dark and heavy
                        velvet, bright-colored silk and silk are popular because wives enjoy wearing them.
