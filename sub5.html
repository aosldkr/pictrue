                <h3>Contemporary Art</h3>
                <p>
                    It includes works of art from around the 1860s to the 1970s, and also refers to the forms
                    and philosophies of art that arose during this period.  Modern art is usually related to
                    art that pursues the spirit of modernism experimentation and abandons the tradition of the
                    past.  Modern artists experimented with new perspectives and fresh ideas about the nature of
                    art's materials and roles. It is a characteristic of more modern art to move away from the
                    description, which is a characteristic of traditional art, and to aim for abstraction is a
                    characteristic of more modern art. Assuming modern art as the history of 20th century art
                    and its transformed process, various and innovative art movements took place in this era.
                    In the 20th century, Germany's expressionism, France's Cubism, Italy's Future, led by the Beast faction, which exploded like a flame. Sofrematism and constructivism in the Soviet Union, neologism in the Netherlands, purism and absolutism in France, and here we go again.Along with ideology and surrealism, 20th-century art has a pattern of controversy.

                    <h3>fauvism Art</h3>
                    <p>
                        Fauvism, or fauvism, was an art trend that briefly emerged in modernist art in the early 20th century.
                        Soon, 20th-century art will be confused between the innovative school based on anti-naturalism and the
                        trend, but it is the movement of the Beast faction that started it. I preferred strong expressions and
                        colors. The trend of the Beast faction itself began around 1900 and lasted until 1910, but the actual
                        Beast faction movement held only three exhibitions in about three years from 1905 to 1907, and its solidarity
                        was weak. The jockeys of the movement included Henri Matisse and Andre Drain. The characteristics of the
                        technique are strong brushstrokes, bold primary color processing, and high-level simplification and abstraction
                        of objects. It expressed the color felt in the heart, not the visible color, brightly and without hesitation.
                        Unlike intellectual cubism, it values emotions. It can also be seen as a form of expressionism.

                    <h3>Cubism Art</h3>
                    <p>
                        a painting movement created by Picasso and Braque in the early 20th century in the Cubist
                        sense It inherited the theory that all forms of Cezanne's natural objects are composed of
                        spherical, cone, and cylinder, and is known as a mainstream art movement against the main
                        principle of the Beast faction.Rece, Poconne, Marie Laurent Saint, and Grays participated
                        in the movement, and poet Apollinaire also supported it from the critic's point of view.
                        Picasso and Braque went further from the simple Cubism of the early days, and rather than
                        the intellectual expression of the composition of the object, they freely handled the
                        intersection of the surface or line of the object. By constructing a new beauty with a sense
                        of rhythm, Fran가ais then laid the foundation for beauty by mathematical theory. After that,
                        the Quibism movement developed into the artist's free expression style, and was divided into
                        constructivism and orpism. It is also the starting point of all modern painting.

                    <h3>Abstract Art</h3>
                    <p>
                        Abstract art is not a concrete form of an object, but rather a flow of art expressed
                        in pure form elements such as dots, lines, faces, and colors. Because shapes and
                        colors have their own meanings and feelings, they can express the thoughts and feelings
                        of the painter just by matching shapes and colors. After modernism, there was a movement
                        to formally define the world away from decorative art, which became the driving force of
                        abstract art. The history of abstract art dates back to the 19th century, and in 1890
                        Maurice Deeney's "Painting is a plane covered with colors of order before war horses
                        or knaves" was also a declaration that put an end to the description or narrative
                        expression of things. In the 20th century, Povism promoted the liberation of colors that
                        Gauguin had already claimed, and Quivism decomposed realistic objects and reconstructed them on the screen.

                    <p>
                        Neoplasticism or de Steele is an art movement that began in the Netherlands in 1917.
                        Theologians found a way to express a new utopian ideal of spiritual harmony and order.
                        They supported pure abstraction and universality, which were simplified into essential
                        elements of form and color, simplifying the visual composition vertically and horizontally,
                        and using only black and white and primary colors. In addition, he pursued beauty through the
                        arrangement of lines, colors, and faces, and soon completed a geometric screen with vertical
                        lines, horizontal lines, red, yellow, and blue three primary colors and achromatic colors
                        as basic molding elements. The asymmetrical but harmonious and balanced composition of
                        intersecting lines and primary colored surfaces, and the full-scale and equilibrium
                        screen without the main and wealth are also characteristics of the work of the neologism period.

                    <h3>expressionism Art</h3>
                    <p>
                        Expressionism was the first term used by German critics in 1911 to describe the work of the Beast, early Cubism,
                        Impressionism, and several other artists who consciously refused to imitate nature. I tried to create art as an
                        extension of subjective reality. It was a reaction to bourgeois perception of reality and conventional art, and
                        it was also a reaction to impressionism that depicted the momentary impression of the material world. Characterized
                        by 'distortion' and 'exaggeration' in expression. Trying to express the meaning or essence of an object that is
                        understood as an emotional and mental experience without being caught up in the external surface of a phenomenon
                        that evokes visual interest or reproduction. Ignoring the laws of perspective, anatomy, lighting, and shading,
                        it emphasizes the expressiveness of lines in line drawings or contours, and uses a small number of intense
                        colors that focus on primary colors rather than subtle shades to provide a contrast effect between simple
                        colors or colors.

                    <p>
                        Futurism is an art movement founded in 1909 by the Italian poet Philippo Tomaso Marinetti.
                        Denying the traditions of the past and praising the speed and machinery of modern civilization
                        was the essence of the city. Although short-lived, Umberto Bochoni, Boris Pasternak, and Vladimir
                        Mayakovsky are representatives of the futuristic movement. The futurist act was practiced throughout
                        the whole field of art. Futurist painters tried to grasp and describe the movement of the object
                        through multiple viewpoints and multiple viewpoints without fixing the viewpoint. In addition,
                        it tried to put the audience in the center of the screen by synthesizing what they are watching
                        and remembering while paying attention to the afterimage of objects.
